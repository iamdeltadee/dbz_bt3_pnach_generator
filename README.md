I enjoy playing Dragon Ball Z - Budokai Tenkaichi 3 on PCSX2 a lot.
To make it even more fun I create a simple (prototype) tool to adjust the amount of health to be in line with power level in the anime.
For unofficial power levels I used some online resources that had those estimated.

To use just build using CMake and run, that will generate a PNACH file next to the executable.

WARNING: This is a prototype and for now only supports the european version of the game.
